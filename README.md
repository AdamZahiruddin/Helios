# Project Helios - Indie JRPG in Development

An ambitious solo-developed 3D JRPG where players explore a shattered world fueled by Ether, battle mutated creatures, and uncover a branching narrative about survival and destiny.

**Built with Unity | All assets made in-house**

## 🚀 Goals
- Create a playable 4-hour public demo (target: October 2025)
- Fully original 3D models, UI, SFX, and lore
- Explore modular asset design and stylized shaders

## 👾 Gameplay Highlights
- Action RPG combat (light/heavy/parry)
- Semi-open area design with NPC hubs
- Skill-based leveling + gear upgrades
- Cutscenes + voiced lines (if possible)

## 🧑‍💻 Want to Contribute?
While this is a solo-driven passion project, I'm open to:
- Collaborating with other developers
- Getting animation or feedback help
- Playtesting and feedback once the demo is live
